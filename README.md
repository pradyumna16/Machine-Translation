Testing Machine Translation

Extract the VectorFiles rar file and put the file in the same folder as rest of the files, if you want to run the Translate file. These files were bit bigger than 25 MB, hence I had to  compress it and upload it. 

sent.de.txt and sent.en.txt are the German and English corpus files. Due to big in size I was unable to upload.
