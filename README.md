Testing Machine Translation

Extract VectorFiles.rar and put the de.vec and en.vec files in the same folder as rest of the files, if you want to run the Translate file. These files were bit bigger than 25 MB, hence I had to  compress it and upload it. Vector files are created using fastText  by Facebook https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText

sent.de.txt and sent.en.txt are the German and English text corpuses. Due to big in size I was unable to upload them. 

I used the data from https://google.github.io/seq2seq/nmt/
